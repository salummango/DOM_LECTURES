    <p>Task 2: Write a function that selects all paragraphs on the webpage and capitalizes their text. DOM objects have a textContent property that you can access to get the text in the element, or set to change the text.</p>
    <p>Hint: Use document.querySelectorAll to get an array of DOM objects. Also, strings have a toUpperCase function that returns the string in all caps.</p>
    <p>this is the second task, now let's look in the first task</p>
